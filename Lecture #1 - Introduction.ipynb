    "# What is OPP?\n",
    "# OPP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).\n",
    "# A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of \"this\" or \"self\")."

    "# Why we use OOP? \n",
    "# OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden\n",
    "# Objects can also be reused within an across applications. The reuse of software also lowers the cost of development. More effort is put into the object-oriented analysis and design, which lowers the overall cost of development.\n",
    "# It makes software easier to maintain. Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale changes\n",
    "# Reuse also enables faster development. Object-oriented programming languages come with rich libraries of objects, and code developed during projects is also reusable in future projects."
